# BFS-in-python
Breadth-First Search is a recursive algorithm to search all the vertices of a graph or a tree. BFS in python can be implemented by using data structures like a dictionary and lists.

<H1> ALGORITHM </H1>

1.	Start by putting any one of the graphâ€™s vertices at the back of the queue.
2.	Now take the front item of the queue and add it to the visited list.
3.	Create a list of that vertex's adjacent nodes. Add those which are not within the visited list to the rear of the queue.
4.	Keep continuing steps two and three till the queue is empty.
